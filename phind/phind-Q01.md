## Question 1

Given I have markdown file prepared for reveal.js like in demo example
* https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-demos/blob/master/audio-slideshow/slides.md
howing how to use audio-slideshow plugin,

I would like to generate using reveal.js / reveal-md static content form such markdown of reveal.js slides using audio-slideshow plugin, with all aseets (image and audio files),  that I can host ,
how to do it?  (( I am linux user, can use Docker files if needed ))

## Assistent Answer 1

Let me help you generate static content from a Reveal.js markdown presentation with the audio-slideshow plugin. I'll break this down into steps.

Let's think about this step-by-step:
1. We need a way to process the markdown and generate static HTML
2. We need to ensure the audio-slideshow plugin is properly included
3. We need to handle asset management (audio, images)
4. We need a way to serve or package everything for hosting

### Key Points to Consider

* reveal-md is a good tool for generating static sites from Reveal.js markdown
* We need to ensure proper plugin configuration
* Asset paths need to be correctly maintained in the static output
* Docker can provide a consistent build environment

### Implementation

Here's a complete solution using Docker:

1. First, create a project structure:
```bash
mkdir reveal-presentation
cd reveal-presentation
mkdir slides
mkdir assets
```

2. Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM node:16

WORKDIR /presentation

# Install reveal-md
RUN npm install -g reveal-md

# Install necessary plugins
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

# Copy presentation files
COPY . .

# Command to generate static site
CMD ["reveal-md", "slides/slides.md", "--static", "dist", "--assets-dir", "assets"]
```

3. Create a `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "reveal.js": "^4.3.1",
    "reveal.js-plugins": "latest"
  }
}
```

4. Create a configuration file `reveal.json`:
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "audio-slideshow",
    "reveal.js-plugins/audio-slideshow/plugin.js"
  ],
  "audio": {
    "prefix": "audio/",
    "suffix": ".ogg",
    "autoplay": false
  }
}
```

5. Build and generate static content:
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t reveal-static .

# Run container to generate static content
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/presentation reveal-static
```

### Usage Instructions

1. Place your markdown file in the `slides` directory
2. Put all audio files in `assets/audio`
3. Put all images in `assets/images`
4. Run the Docker commands above
5. The static site will be generated in the `dist` directory

### Best Practices

* Keep assets organized in separate directories
* Use relative paths in markdown files
* Test the generated output locally before hosting
* Include all necessary plugins in the configuration
* Maintain a consistent file structure

### Summary

This solution provides a reproducible way to generate static Reveal.js presentations with audio support. The Docker-based approach ensures consistency and handles all dependencies. The generated `dist` directory will contain everything needed for hosting, including properly linked assets and plugins.

To host the presentation:
1. Copy the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server
2. Ensure all file permissions are set correctly
3. Access through a web browser

The presentation should work with all audio and image assets properly linked and the audio-slideshow plugin functioning as expected.
